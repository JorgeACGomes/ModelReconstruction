"""
FASTCORE Algorithm for context specific metabolic network reconstruction
by: Nikos Vlassis, Maria Pires Pacheco, Thomas Sauter

Inputs: 
    - A consistent metabolic network model {N, Sn} where:
        -N is the reaction set {1,2,3, ...} 
        -Sn is the stoichiometric matrix
        * To be consistent a metabolic network model must have no blocked reactions. To accomplish this simplify (model)
        from framed package can be used
    - Core reaction set C that are supported by strong evidence to be active in the desired context such that
        - C contains some but not all of N, thus, a strict subset of N

Outputs:
    - A consistent induced subnetwork {A, Sa} of {N, Sn} such that all of C is included in A (subset)
    
Notes:
    * A mode is a feasible flux vector that satisfies a group of steady-state constraints namely :
        - Sv = 0
        - v (belongs to) B, with B being the lower and upper bound per reaction , i.e. B = [lb, ub]
    * In a mode, the set of nonzero entries are known as the support of that node.
    * An elementary mode is a feasible flux vector v!=0 with minimal support. That is, there is no other mode which has 
    a smaller support set.
    * A reaction i is called blocked if it cannot be active under any mode, that is, there is no mode v, where vi != 0 
    * A dense mode is a mode that contains as many nonzero fluxes as possible.
    * A sparse mode is a mode that contains as many zero fluxes as possible.
