#Using TSM-Rec 



A complete guide on how to use the TSM-Rec tool is available in a Jupyter Notebook file: **"TSM-Rec: The How to Guide"**

The guide details the reconstruction pipeline used for the glioma test-case and for an additional example case.

This folder also contains the files necessary to run the glioma testcase. Be sure to provide the path to each one when using TSM-Rec.

Inside the "TSM-Rec: The How to Guide" the utility of every file is detailed.
